This folder is where you perform the conversion of the originally downloaded ERA* reanalysis files towards the RPN fst format used 
by the WEST classification programs.

The conversion tool is pythonic and combines functions from ECcodes and rpnpy, the RMNLIB pythonic interface to the FST I/O routines.
