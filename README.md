# Geostrophic-climate
This is the code for a new component being added to the WEST toolkit 
It's purpose is the classification of Reanalysis time series of geostrophic wind (or pressure gradient) 
to fabricate the frequencies tables (table.ef of WEST) used as input for the mesoscale downscaling step of WEST, 
the main ingredient to eventually generate the wind energy potential (U^^3) maps
